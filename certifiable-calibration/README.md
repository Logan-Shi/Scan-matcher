## MATLAB Code for Egomotion Sensor Calibration
See the [`matlab/`](https://github.com/utiasSTARS/certifiable-calibration/tree/master/matlab) directory for instructions on how to run the algorithm from [our 2019 RA-L publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03554.pdf). The [`data/`](https://github.com/utiasSTARS/certifiable-calibration/tree/master/data) directory contains files with experimental results from our paper.


## Python Code for Monocular Hand-Eye Calibration
See the [`python/extrinsic_calibration`](https://github.com/utiasSTARS/certifiable-calibration/tree/master/python/extrinsic_calibration) directory for instructions on how to run the algorithm from [our paper in submission to IEEE MFI 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08298).
