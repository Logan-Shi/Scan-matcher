# Globally Optimal Extrinsic Calibration for Egomotion Sensors
Certifiably globally optimal extrinsic calibration of sesnors capable of providing egomotion estimates. The problem our code solves is also commonly called "hand-eye calibration", or the `AX=XB` problem.

## Installation and Dependencies 

All code and experiments were developed in MATLAB R2017b.

We use the [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) modelling language, which is free for academic usage, for all convex optimization. The default SDPT3 solver that ships with CVX was used.

Our plotting script makes use of the [`subaxis`](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3696-subaxis-subplot) function to create subplots. 

Our experiments made use of the code and dataset available [here](http://jbrookshire.com/projects_3dcalib.htm), which is not freely available but can be requested from the author for academic purposes. Much of the data loaded and used in our results comes from applications of that code.

## Usage 
All necessary code is found in this folder. Be sure to add this folder and its subfolders to your MATLAB path.

### Plotting Script
The code for plots appearing in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03554.pdf) listed below can be run with the script `plot_ral_figures.m`. This script uses the `.mat` files containing experimental results in `../data/`. The data files are addressed relatively, so be sure to run the script from within this folder.

### Calibration Example Script
The script `example_egomotion_calibration.m` shows a sample usage of the function `egomotion_calibration/egomotion_calibration.m` on simulated noisy data.
